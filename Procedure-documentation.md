# Procedure Documentation for Comparator Experiment in DLD lab

### Introduction:

This document captures the instructions to run the simulation for comparator experiment in DLD lab(vlabs.co.in)

### Instructions:

1. The toolbox on the left contains the pre-made logic circuits you will require to build a counter.

2. Drag them on the right, to place them on your breadboard.

3. The left part of the abstracted circuit contains the inputs, and the right side the outputs.

4. Click on the circle of the input or output to another input/output to make a connection.

5. You can connect only one line to an input, but an output can have multiple lines.

6. The "DC" icon outputs digital 1 at all times, connnect it to:
  	* -push on: to simulate the 1 only when you're pressing on the button
	* -push off: to simulate 0 when you're pushing the button
	* -toggle: to toggle the output between 1 and 0.
	
7. The OSC supplies 1 and 0 in a specific frequency which you set in the settings pane.

8. The joint icon is just a connection, to make your connections look neater, as the lines from an output to an input are straight.

9. The DSO displays the output in a graph format for easy verification. It has 8 inputs, you can choose to use any number of them. If you want more, just drag drop more of them.

10. To save the logic circuit for future reference load the circuit data in the textbox and save it as a File in your machine.

11. Load the file which has the circuit data and click on ssimulate button to get the logic circuit.

12. If you have any trouble to make a 2-bit comparator then click on the Load 2-bit comparator button to get it's simulation.
