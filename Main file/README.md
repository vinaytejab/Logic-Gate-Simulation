# LOGIC GATE SIMULATION USING JS,HTML,CSS:

### Please Run ##simulation.html.

About the Simulator:

    The left pane has different options to help the user.
    	The textbox acts as a medium to help user to save and input circuit data from the the local system.

    		-When 'Get circuit data' button is clicked the data of the ciruit drawn on the workspace is shown in the textbox and tho save the data user can set the name of the file and click on 'Save as Text File' button to download it.

    		-In order to input the data from local system user can select the file using the 'Choose File' button and the click on 'Load the Selected File' button to see the data in the textbox (make changes to it if needed)  and click on the 'Set Data' button to see the Simulation in the WorkSpace.

    		-To Clear the workspace and start a fresh simulation click on 'Clear Workspace' button. 
        

    The right pane contains the workspace where you will simulate your experiment.

        -The panel on the left contains the pre-made logic circuits you will require to build a counter.
        -Drag them on the right, to place them on your breadboard.
        -The left side contains the inputs, and the right side the outputs.
        -Click on the circle of the input or output to another input/output to draw a line.
        -You can connect only one line to an input, but an output can have multiple lines.

        -The DC icon outputs digital 1 at all times, connnect it to 
            -push on: to simulate the 1 only when you're pressing on the button
            -push off: to simulate 0 when you're pushing the button
            -toggle: to toggle the output between 1 and 0.

        -The OSC supplies 1 and 0 in a specific frequency which you set in the settings pane.

        -The joint icon is just a connection, to make your connections look neater, as the lines from an output to an input are straight.

		-The DSO displays the output in a graph format for easy verification. It has 4 inputs, you can choose to use any number of them. If you want more, just drag drop more of them.

		-In order to get a pre-made 2-bit comparator click on the 'Load 2-bit Comparator' button to see its simulation.
